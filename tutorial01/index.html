       <h1>I want to go outside</h1>
       <p>
         We're deep into this strange, frightening, and difficult new reality, when going outside must serve essential purposes during the coronavirus pandemic. For many of us, moving our body is still one of them. If you've been trying to run, you are not alone. In neighborhoods across the country, people have been out there, pushing their bodies forward at all paces to feel a small sense of freedom, control, and release in a time where we're surrounded by a lot of darkness.

       <p>
         But it's concerning, thinking about breathing as you navigate sidewalks and other people. Running is also hard. It can be boring and painful, and it's often difficult to ignore your brain when it's screaming at you to give up. In sum, running right now seems impossible. It doesn't have to be.
